What I built today:
* Landing page v1 (index.html + style.css)
* Interactive button with hover effect
* Learning progress card section

What I learned:
* HTML structure and tags
* CSS styling (colors, fonts, spacing)
* How to link CSS to HTML
* Button hover effects
* Box shadows and border-radius

What confused me:
* the red squiggly lines in the styles.css

Does the page load in Chrome: yes

Screenshot saved: yes

Next step tomorrow:
* Add a new section + CTA and deploy on Vercel
